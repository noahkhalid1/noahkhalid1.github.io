</P>I joined this class a little late in the first week of school. When I joined I was pretty confused on what the class was and what I would be doing in the class. In my first class I was told what had happened in the classes I missed and was guided to create the things I needed to create. When I was introduced to creating a website, I was interested but still very confused on how to create or start one. So I asked some friends and we worked on it together. I was able to create a HTML page and start my code. I started by making a style page and learned how to create a shape. I played around with that until I created a shape I really liked. Then I added a transition time and a div for it to change color when I hover over it. After that, I had my shape in a div and made many more of the same divs. That is how I got so many of the same shape. Then at the top of my body paragraph I added some text. This is how a created my first project and how I was introduced to so many important things in HTML.</p>
