	I joined this class a little late in the first week of school. When I joined I was pretty confused on what the class was and what I would be doing in the class. In my first class I was told what had happened in the classes a missed and was guided to create the things I needed to create. When I was introduced to this project, I was intrested but still very confused on how to create or start this project.
